BEGINING IMPLEMENTATION
For me How I run the program, I simply use the run code button for visual studio at teh top right of visual studio code.
But, you can use the path of the file for Pylox.py and then smoketest.lox or nothing for the REPL command line in the terminal. Use 'exit' to exit from the REPL command line.
Also, make sure your in the Pylox.py file when the run the program
Email me at david.groom@cornerstone.edu if you have problems


VISITOR PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION

For running the visit pattern, you simply need to go to the visitorpatten.py and execute the program via terminal. 
You can do this by the path or by using the Go icon in the top right.
Everything needed is in teh visitorpattern.py

PARSER IMPLEMENTATION

For the parser, running the program is the same for the BEGINING implementation. Simply create a new ternimal in the Pylox.py folder, 
and then either run the program using the start button, or by using the path of the program and the path of the file you want to run.
